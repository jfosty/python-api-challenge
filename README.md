# Prior to submission of code, I cleared out all outputs. I left the install code of the Citipy and Geoviews library but hashed it out. I ran into an issue where I needed to re-install in once so in case the grader, needs to install, you can un-hash the code and do that first. 

# WeatherPY uses the python library "Citipy" https://pypi.org/project/citipy/
# WeatherPY uses the Weather API from https://openweathermap.org/api
# VacationPY uses the python library "geoviews" from https://geoviews.org/
# VacationPY also uses the geoviews api to get hotel data 

# I referenced the professor's skeleton code from class and some of the discussion in the slack group chat.
